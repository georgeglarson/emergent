Decision: Proceed with implementing a Python script to calculate Fibonacci numbers as per the primary objective.
Decision: Use a simple iterative approach for Fibonacci number calculation for clarity and efficiency.
Decision: Create a single Python file named fibonacci.py in the project directory.
Decision: Include a main block to allow running the script standalone.
Decision: Add basic input validation to handle user input for Fibonacci calculation.
Decision: Write a simple test function to verify correctness of the implementation.
Decision: Document the approach and implementation in the code comments.
